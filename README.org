#+TITLE: commit-and-tag-version.el

[[LICENSE][https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL_3-green.svg]]

Generate and update the CHANGELOG in the [[https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog][conventional-changelog]] style on Emacs.
This package provides the interface ~conventional-changelog-menu~, which is
built with [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]], between command-line tool [[https://github.com/absolute-version/commit-and-tag-version][commit-and-tag-version]] and
Emacs. Call ~conventional-changelog-menu~ to start.

This is based off the original work [[https://github.com/liuyinz/emacs-conventional-changelog][emacs-conventional-changelog]] by [[https://github.com/liuyinz][liuyinz]]. The
author has since deprecated the project and has since developed a new package,
[[https://github.com/liuyinz/git-cliff.el][git-cliff.el]], that generates CHANGELOGs using [[https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff][git-cliff]]. To discern this project
from the original, the name is changed to =commit-and-tag-version.el=.
